A mini search engine built to understand how real-world search systems work beyond SEO concepts.
 
I am a 2nd-year CSDS (Computer Science & Data Science) student, and during my coursework—particularly in the Digital Marketing (DM) subject we studied concepts such as search engine optimization (SEO), website ranking, and how content visibility can be improved on the web.
While these topics explained how websites are ranked, they did not explain how a search engine itself actually works internally.
This gap sparked my curiosity.
To deeply understand the end-to-end working of a search engine, I decided to build a mini search engine from scratch, implementing the core components that real-world search systems use.

## Features
- Web crawling using sitemaps
- Keyword-based search (BM25)
- Semantic search using embeddings
- Hybrid ranking (keyword + semantic)
- Result highlighting
- Strict handling of invalid queries

## Run Instructions
Detailed setup instructions are provided in the respective folders.
